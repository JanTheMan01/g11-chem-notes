# Ion
An atom or molecule with a net electric charge due to the loss or gain of one or more electrons.

# Cation
An ion with a **Positive** charge

# Anion
An ion with a **Negative** charge

# Criss Cross Rule
Set the subscripts of ions in a reaction to the opposite ions' charge, removing the sign as you do so.  Reduce to if necessary.

$H^{1+} + O^{2-} \rightarrow H^{-1} \searrow \swarrow O^{2-} \rightarrow H_2O$

# Aqueous
Is Dissolved in water.  
Ex. All acids must be dissolved in water (aqueous) to classify as acids

# Covalent Bond
A chemical bond between non-metals that occurs via the **sharing** of valence electrons

# Ionic
