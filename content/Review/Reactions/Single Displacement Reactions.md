Single displacement reactions occur when a solo element replaces another element in a compound

## $A + BC \rightarrow B + AC$

>[!info]
>Not every combination of an element and a compound will result in a reaction.  Make sure to look at the activity series to see if a reaction is possible before trying to predict it.  If the solo element is higher up on the series than the element it is trying to replace, the reaction is possible

#### Examples of Single Displacement reactions
##### $Mg + Cu(SO_4) \rightarrow Cu + Mg(SO_4)$

##### $Zn + HCl \rightarrow H_2 + ZnCl_2$
