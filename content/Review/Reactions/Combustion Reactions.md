Combustion occurs when a Hydrocarbon (a compound comprised of solely Hydrogen and Carbon atoms), reacts with Oxygen, often producing byproducts of light and heat.

### Complete Combustion
Complete combustion occurs when the combustible is burned through completely, leaving byproducts of $CO_{2(g)}$ and $H_2O_{(g)}$

### Incomplete Combustion
Incomplete combustion occurs when there is not enough oxygen in the atmosphere to fully burn through the combustible.  The products of an incomplete combustion reaction are varying amounts of $CO_{2(g)}$, $H_2O_{(g)}$, $CO_{(g)}$ (Carbon Monoxide), and $C_{(s)}$ (Soot or Char)
