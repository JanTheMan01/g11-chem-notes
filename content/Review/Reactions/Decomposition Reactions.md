Decomposition reactions are the opposite of synthesis reactions, and result in a compound turning into its components
## $AB \rightarrow A + B$

>[!info]
>Decomposition reactions don't always result in the compound turning into individual elements, but they can instead decompose into two smaller compounds
#### Examples of Decomposition reactions
##### $ZnCO_3 \rightarrow ZnO + CO_2$

##### $H_2O \rightarrow H_2 + O_2$
