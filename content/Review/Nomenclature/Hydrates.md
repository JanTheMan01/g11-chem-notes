#### Hydrate
Ionic compounds which have water molecules $(H_2O)$ incorporated into their crystals in a specific ratio

Water molecules in a hydrate aren't necessarily 'trapped' within the compound, but are instead part of the actual crystals in the compound

----
#### Formula
When writing the formula for a hydrate, simply write the water molecule as if it was being "multiplied" with the ionic compound
###### Examples
=> $CaCl_2 \cdot 2H_2O$ -> 1:2 ratio of $CaCl_2$ : $H_2O$
=> $LiCl \cdot 4H_2O$ -> 1:4 ratio of $LiCl$ : $H_2O$

---
#### Naming
When writing the name for a hydrate, put the name of the original ionic compound, followed by the [[Molecular Compounds#Greek Prefixes|Greek Prefix]]+ "Hydrate"
###### Examples
=> $CaCl_2 \cdot 2H_2O \rightarrow \textit{Calcium Chloride Dihydrate}$
=> $LiCl \cdot 4H_2O \rightarrow \textit{Lithium Chloride Tetrahydrate}$

>[!tip]
>When all the water is removed from a hydrate, it becomes an **anhydrous salt**
