## Peroxides

- The $O-O$ group attached to another element
	- An extra oxygen is present in an otherwise recognizable compound

$O-O$ Group = $[ O_2 ]^{2-}$ 

###### EXAMPLES
$H_2O_2$ -> Hydrogen Peroxide 
- Similar to Water ($H_2O$), but with an extra $O$ present

$Na_2O_2$ -> Sodium Peroxide
- Similar to Sodium Oxide ($Na_2O$), but with an extra $O$ present

$Li_2O_2$ -> Lithium Peroxide
- Similar to Lithium Oxide ($Li_2O$), but with an extra $O$ present

$CaO_2$ -> Calcium Peroxide
- Similar to Calcium Oxide ($CaO$), but with an extra $O$ present
