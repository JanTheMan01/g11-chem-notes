#### Molecule
Two or more non-metal atoms connected by a [[Definitions#Covalent Bond|covalent bond]]


#### Diatomic Molecule
Two of the **same element** in a covalent bond
###### List of Diatomic Molecules:
-> Hydrogen => $H_2$
-> Oxygen => $O_2$
-> Fluorine => $F_2$
-> Bromine => $Br_2$
-> Iodine => $I_2$
-> Nitrogen => $N_2$
-> Chlorine => $Cl_2$

(Remember **H O F Br I N Cl**)

----
### Naming Molecular Compounds
-> When naming & writing molecular compounds, the element **furthest to the left** on the Periodic Table comes first.

-> When writing the formula for a $Carbon$ + $Oxygen$ Compound, you would put Carbon first, since it is further to the left than oxygen.  In practice, this would look like this:
	$\textit{Carbon + Oxygen} \rightarrow \textit{Carbon Dioxide}$
	
	$C + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2$

-> The first element will retain its name
-> The second element will drop its ending for an "-ide" ending

>[!warning]
>When naming molecular formulas, DO NOT simplify subscripts unless asked to do so
>(Leave $H_2O_2$ as $H_2O_2$)

-> Use Greek prefixes to identify how many of each element is in the molecule
	If the first element only has one atom, do not use a prefix
##### Greek Prefixes
Mono - 1
Di - 2
Tri - 3
Tetra - 4
Penta - 5
Hexa - 6
Hepta - 7
Octa - 8
Nona - 9
Deca - 10

#### EXAMPLES
$N_2O_5 \rightarrow \textit{Dinitrogen Pentoxide}$

$SO_2 \rightarrow \textit{Sulfur Dioxide}$

$PH_3 \rightarrow \textit{Phosphorus Trihydride}$


$\textit{Diphosphorus Pentoxide} \rightarrow P_2O_5$

$\textit{Carbon Dioxide} \rightarrow CO_2$

$\textit{Carbon Tetraiodide} \rightarrow CI_5$
